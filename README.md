# CSS Framework Design Comparison

This project provides a visual comparison of three popular CSS frameworks: **Bootstrap**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Bulma**. It demonstrates how each framework styles common UI components, allowing you to see the differences and similarities in design and implementation.

## Features

- **Bootstrap:** Demonstrates default components such as cards, buttons, modals, grids, and more.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Showcases utility-first styling with components like cards, buttons, grids, and custom modals.
- **Bulma:** Highlights Bulmaâ€™s simplicity with components like notifications, inputs, modals, and columns.
